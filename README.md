# PortScanner

this code is make to scan ports for IPs and website url

I put it to scan from port 20 to 100 by default 

you can change the range by edit the line 7 

you can check IPs one by one or put them togather with ',' between them.

I know that there are tools to make this but I loved to share the way that you can do it by your self and understand how it work so you can modify it as you wish.
